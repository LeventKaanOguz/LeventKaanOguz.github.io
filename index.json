Also, basic GitHub knowledge is recommended but it is not a prerequisite. Hugo Extended Installation: You should follow the instructions appropiate for your system here.

After creating your website using below section, you should create a .\\public\\ folder under the main folder (like blog\\public) and also create a folder under somewhere else as like LeventKaanOguz.github.io and push a README.md file.
