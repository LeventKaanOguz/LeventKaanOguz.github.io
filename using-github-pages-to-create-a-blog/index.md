# Using GitHub Pages to Create a Blog


## Prerequisites

* **GitHub Account:** You can open one from [here](https://github.com).
* **Hugo Installation:** You should follow the instructions appropiate for your system [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
* **A Preffered Choice of Theme:** You can of course build your own theme but it is better to choose one from [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). For instance, I use [LoveIt](https://hugoloveit.com/) theme.
* Love for phys... just kidding, the other thing we need is to desire for this website.
